          Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrigâ€™s
          Disease, is a disease that affects parts of the nervous system that
          control voluntary muscle movements (the muscles that people move at
          will, like those of the arms and legs).

            ALS is referred to as a progressive disease, meaning the symptoms
            continue to get worse over time. People with ALS gradually lose
            strength in their muscles and become weaker, which can limit
            movement and the ability to live an independent life. As ALS
            progresses, it will eventually affect muscles that control
            breathing, as well as chewing and swallowing food. Currently, there
            is no cure for ALS. However, it's important to ask your healthcare
            provider(s) about treatment options.

                Motor neurons provide a vital line of communication between the
                brain and the muscles, which produce movements like walking,
                talking, breathing, and swallowing.

          </ul>
          <p className="mt-8">
            In people with ALS, these motor neurons stop working. When this
            happens, the brain can no longer communicate with the muscles. Over
            time, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control certain
            muscle movements, resulting in progressive weakness and paralysis.
            People living with ALS may eventually need assistance with speaking,
            eating, and breathing on their own.
